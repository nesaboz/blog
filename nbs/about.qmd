I'm a software engineer with PhD in Electrical Engineering. I've published
Science Journal paper with 2500+ [citations](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2yl9qR4AAAAJ&hl=en),
[patented](https://testpubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/patent/WO-2020243015-A1) instrument software that enabled COVID-19 antibody
[discovery](https://www.berkeleylights.com/blog/racing-to-find-the-right-cells-our-covid-19-success-stories/), and built optical
instruments that went to the bottom of the
ocean. I'm passionate about machine learning,
innovation, and great teams.

When not messing with code, I arm-wrestle with my 3-year old twins, do yoga,
mountain bike, ski, kite-surf and hone my darts' skills.
