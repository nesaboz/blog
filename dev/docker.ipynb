    "A docker contain is a great way to set up an environment. Once the docker container is built and running, one can attach to it from VSCode and use it as a remote machine. To do this, install \"Remote Development\" extension [pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack), then one can attach the container in VSCode by going to a command pallette (Cmd+Shift+P) and typing \"Attach to running container\". If running into a user issue, you need to add user to docker group:\n",
    "```zsh\n",
    "sudo usermod -aG docker $USER\n",
    "```\n",
    "and (maybe, not always) restart the machine.\n",

    "To see running containers' info from paperspace machine use:\n",
