I'm a software engineer with PhD in Electrical Engineering. I've published
Science Journal paper with 2500+ citations,
patented instrument software that enabled COVID-19 antibody
discovery, and built optical
instruments that went to the bottom of the
ocean. I'm passionate about machine learning,
innovation, and great teams.

When not messing with code, I arm-wrestle with my 3-year old twins, do yoga,
mountain bike, ski, and hone my darts' skills.
