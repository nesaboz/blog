The goal of the project was to extract all sorts of data from 11'000+ pdf files that contain California Transportation contracts, available publicly, as part of a large research project. Considering well structured text the first decision was to extract data using [Regural expressions i.e. regex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression), 
and I relied heavily on [regex101.com](https://regex101.com) for prototyping. Initial EDA showed that there were dozens of formatting variations and final logic was a mix of regex and Python as regex alone was not able to cover all the use cases. I learned more about `regex` that I probably wanted to know, and realized its power and limitations.
