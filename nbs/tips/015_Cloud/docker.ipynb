    "A docker contain is a great way to set up an environment. Once the docker container is built and running, one can attach to it from VSCode and use it as a remote machine. To do this, install \"Remote Development\" extension [pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack), then one can attach the container in VSCode by going to a command pallette (Cmd+Shift+P) and typing \"Attach to running container\". If typing `sudo` all the time is annoying add user to the docker group:\n",
