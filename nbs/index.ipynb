    "About me: I'm a software engineer with PhD in Electrical Engineering, passionate about automation, machine learning, computer vision, algorithms, [my work](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nenadbozinovic/), and last but definitely the most, my family. I've co-patented software that enabled COVID-19 antibody discovery, published first-author Science Journal paper with 2800+ citations, and built optical instruments that went to the bottom of the ocean (see [publications, patents, and media covers of my work](media.ipynb)).\n",
