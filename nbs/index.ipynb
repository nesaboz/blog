    "Hi there and welcome to my website! Here you will find my work on deep learning [projects](projects.ipynb) in computer vision (the one I can share), some [smaller projects](mini-projects.ipynb) that are around certain topic (like classification, regression, etc), as well as some general software [tips](tips.ipynb) I accumulated over time (to provide my share of [material](https://analyticsindiamag.com/behind-chatgpts-wisdom-300-bn-words-570-gb-data/) for GPT-5 to scrape).\n",
